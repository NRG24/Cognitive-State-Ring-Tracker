This is a sensor packed device that features a GSR sensor and max30102 sensor that measure skin electrical conductivity (arousal), temperature, spo2, heart rate, HRV, and an accelerometer for filtering. The point of this is to build a tracker that isn't focused on fitness, but cognitive health tied to the nervous system. These sensors will be packed into a small flex PCB in a ring shape.. All of the circuitry has been tested in LT-Spice to ensure electrical correctness. The key point of this project is to have this ring focused on mental and cognitive health rather than fitness and physical health. So, the sensors send data to the Raytac nRF52840 module and the Raytac sends it to a mobile device via BLE. The data goes through a filter in the app, removing any outliers. Additionally, in the app there is a "Cognitive Score." The app interprets all the data and based off of an algorithm, it can give you a score out of 100 as well as some insights.

In this GitHub, I have the PCB, Schematic, and all of the KiCad data, the Flutter app code, the code for the MCU, the 3D CAD Model, and the Bill of Materials Link Below.
